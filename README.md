Currently a work in progress! Works on simple websites but seems to have issues with more complex ones and with lazy loading...

Quickly clone a website and launch an HTTP server to phish information with httphish.py üêç

## Prerequisites

This script currently requires the `wget` command on linux through the `os` module.

## Usage

Simply launch httphish.py and it will ask you all pertinent questions!
